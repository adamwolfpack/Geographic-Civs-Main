# Geographic-Civs
Inspired by Upside-Down, instead this mod use geographical setting.

Civ included:
East Asia:			  Japan, China, Mongolia, Korea + Rusia
Middle East:		  Babylon, Arabia, The Ottomans, Persia
Western Europe:		Austria, France, Germany, Holland
Northern Europe:	Denmark, Sweden, England, Celts
Southern Europe:	Roma, Greece, Spain, Byzantium
Africa:				    Egypt, Songhai, Ethiopia, Kartago
NS America:			  Aztecs, Inca, Maya, Iroquis, USA
Oceania:			  Polynesia + Siam + Huns + India

Notes:
- Geographically, Rusia is in North Asia. Thus they should be separated from East Asia. But by doing so, they will likely be alone country, and nothing differ with Rusia from the base game. That is why, for the time being, they join East Asia.
- Huns (Eastern Europe), Siam (Southeast Asia), India (South Asia), and Polynesia (Oceania) are all alone. I decided to make them as one civ.
